# User Guide
## Configuration File
Under the `nntrader/nntrader` directory, there is a json file called `net_config.json`,
 holding all the configuration of the agent and could be modified outside the program code.
### Network Topology
* `"layers"`
    * layers list of the CNN, including the output layer
    * `"type"`
        * domain is {"ConvLayer", "FullyLayer", "DropOut", "MaxPooling",
        "AveragePooling", "LocalResponseNormalization", "SingleMachineOutput",
        "LSTMSingleMachine", "RNNSingleMachine"}
    * `"filter shape"`
        * shape of the filter (kernal) of the Convolution Layer
* `"input"`
    * `"window_size"`
        * number of columns of the input matrix
    * `"coin_number"`
        * number of rows of the input matrix
    * `"feature_number"`
        * number of features (just like RGB in computer vision)
        * domain is {1, 2, 3}
        * 1 means the feature is ["close"], last price of each period
        * 2 means the feature is ["close", "volume"]
        * 3 means the features are ["close", "high", "low"]

### Market Data
* `"input "`
    * `"start_date"`
        * start date of the global data matrix
        * format is yyyy/MM/dd
    * `"end_date"`
        * start date of the global data matrix
        * format is yyyy/MM/dd
        * The performance could varied a lot in different time ranges.
    * `"volume_average_days"`
        * number of days of volume used to select the coins
    * `"test_portion"`
        * portion of backtest data, ranging from 0 to 1. The left is training data.
    * `"global_period"`
        * trading period and period of prices in input window.
        * should be a multiple of 300 (seconds)
    * `"coin_number"`
        * number of assets to be traded.
        * does not include cash (i.e. btc)
    * `"online"`
        * if it is not online, the program will select coins and generate inputs
        from the local database.
        * if it is online, new data that dose not exist in the database would be saved

## Training and Tuning the hyper-parameters
1. First, modify the `nntrader/nntrader/net_config.json` file.
2. make sure current directory is under `nntrader` and type `python main.py --mode=generate --repeat=1`
    * this will make 1 subfolders under the `train_package`
    * in each subfloder, there is a copy of the `net_config.json`
    * `--repeat=n`, n could followed by any positive integers. The random seed of each the subfolder is from 0 to n-1 sequentially.
      * Notably, random seed could also affect the performance in a large scale.
3. type `python main.py --mode=train --processes=1`
    * this will start training one by one of the n floders created just now
    * do not start more than 1 processes if you want to download data online
    * "--processes=n" means start n processes running parallely.
    * add "--device=gpu" if your tensorflow support gpu.
      * On GTX1080Ti you should be able to run 4-5 training process together.
      * On GTX1060 you should be able to run 2-3 training together.
    * Each training process is made up from 2 stages:
      * Pre-training, log example:
      
      
```
INFO:root:average time for data accessing is 0.00070324587822
INFO:root:average time for training is 0.0032548391819
INFO:root:==============================
INFO:root:step 3000
INFO:root:------------------------------
INFO:root:the portfolio value on test set is 2.24213
log_mean is 0.00029086
loss_value is -0.000291
log mean without commission fee is 0.000378

INFO:root:==============================

```
        
        
      * Backtest with rolling train, log example:
```
        DEBUG:root:==============================
INFO:root:the step is 1433
INFO:root:total assets are 17.732482 BTC
```
4. after that, check the result summary of the training in `nntrader/train_package/train_summary.csv`
5. tune the hyper-parameters based on the summary, and go to 1 again.

## Logging
There are three types of logging of each training.
* In each subfloder
    * There is a text file called `programlog`, which is the log generated by the running programming.
    * There is a `tensorboard` folder saves the data about the training process which could be viewed by tensorboard.
        * type `tensorboard --logdir=train_package/1` to use tensorboard
* The summary infomation of this training, including network configuration, portfolio value on validation set and test set etc., will be saved in the `train_summary.csv` under `train_pakage` folder

## Save and Restore of the Model
* The trained weights of the network are saved at `train_package/1` named as `netfile` (including 3 files). 

## Download Data
* Type `python main.py --mode=download_data` you can download data without starting training
* The program will use the configurations in `nntrader/nntrader/net_config` to select coins and
  download necessary data to train the network.
* The downloading speed could be very slow and sometimes even have error in China.
* For those who cann't download data, please check the first release where there is a `Data.db` file, put it in the database folder. Make sure the `online` in `input` in `net_config.json` to be `false` and run the example.
  * Note that using the this file, you shouldn't make any changes to input data configuration(For example `start_date`, `end_date` or `coin_number`) otherwise incorrect result might be presented.
## Back-test
* Type `python main.py --mode=backtest --algo=1` to execute
backtest with rolling train(i.e. online learning in supervised learning)
on the target model.
* `--algo` could be either the name of traditional method or the index of training folder

## Tradition Agent
OLPS summary:

## Ploting
* type `python main.py --mode=plot --algos=crp,olmar,1 --labels=crp,olmar,nnagent
`,for example, to plot
* `--algos` could be the name of the tdagent algorithms or
the index of nnagent
* `--labels` is the name of related algorithm that will be shown in the legend
* result is

## present backtest results in a table
* type `python main.py --mode=table --algos=1,olmar,ons --labels=nntrader,olmar,ons`
* `--algos` and `--lables` are the same as in plotting case
* result:
```
           average  max drawdown  negative day  negative periods  negative week  portfolio value  positive periods  postive day  postive week  sharpe ratio

```
* use `--format` arguments to change the format of the table,
 could be `raw` `html` `csv` or `latex`. The default one is raw.
